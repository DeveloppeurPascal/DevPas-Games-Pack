# All public DeveloppeurPascal game projects in one code repository

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

All the source codes of the games released on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal). They are mainly programmed in Delphi.

Some of them were developed [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) during game coding sessions. You can see [replays on Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/jeux-video.php).

This code repository contains projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Games list

Making games isn't as complicated as it sounds. It can be fun, and it's educational (even if it sometimes takes a lot of stamina and courage not to give up on the party in mid-journey).

Delphi is fairly simple to use and learn. FireMonkey offers everything you need to create games. Try your hand at it, using [Delphi Game Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine) for the basic functions, or directly using [this video game starter kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Gamolf-FMX-Game-Starter-Kit).

## Project packages

To simplify GitHub account backups or local installation of projects, I offer several thematic repository packs. You can use them to download the relevant projects and check them out. They're probably not compilable as is, but they'll give you an idea of the open source projects available on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal), and you'll still be able to access them directly.

* [video games](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Games-Pack)
* [utilities and mobile applications](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-WorkingPrograms-Pack)
* [libraries and components](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack)
* [repo templates and starter kits](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-TemplatesAndStarterKits-Pack)
* [all the public projects in my account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects)

To prepare my Delphi developer work environment on a new Windows computer or VM, I've also included [an installation script](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi). You can use it as is, or take inspiration from it if you're using my libraries or components.

If you're looking for examples and demos of how to use certain Delphi features, take a look at [this code repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples) and [its list of other example repositories](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples/blob/main/OtherDelphiSampleRepositories.md).
