# All public DeveloppeurPascal game projects in one code repository

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

All the source codes of the games released on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal). They are mainly programmed in Delphi.

Some of them were developed [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) during game coding sessions. You can see [replays on Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/jeux-video.php).

This code repository contains projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
